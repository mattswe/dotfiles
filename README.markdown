# dotfiles

If you listen closely to my dotfiles, you can hear a tumbleweed bouncing across the desert

## install

- `git clone git@github.com:sweenzor/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles`
- `cd ~/.dotfiles`
- `script/bootstrap`

The bootstrap script will symlink the appropriate files in `.dotfiles` to your
home directory. Everything is configured and tweaked within `~/.dotfiles`,
though.

## thanks

Forked from [Holman](http://github.com/holman):

[dotfiles](http://github.com/ryanb/dotfiles) for a couple years before the
weight of my changes and tweaks inspired me to finally roll my own. But Ryan's
dotfiles were an easy way to get into bash customization, and then to jump ship
to zsh a bit later. A decent amount of the code in these dotfiles stem or are
inspired from Ryan's original project.
